					Well, I guess I like challenges. I voluntarily expose myself to them
					on a regular basis practicing a martial art called Brasilian
					Jiu-Jitsu. The core principle is that you can neutralise a bigger and
					stronger opponent using pure technique. Itâ€™s a form a problem solving
					and that is also what drives my other interest: front-end developing.{' '}

					I am currently studying to become a programmer at{' '}
					<a href='https://kyh.se/'>KYH</a> and it is as fun as it is
					complicated, and that is exactly how I like it! My latest project has
					been learning ReactJS and I learned to build a "Burger Builder" from
					scratch as you can see{' '}
					<a href='https://react-my-burger-9170e.web.app/'>here</a>.{' '}

				<p>To balance it all I spend a lot of time in nature. </p>
